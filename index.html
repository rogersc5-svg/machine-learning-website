        <h2>What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers 
            to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being directly programmed.
            ML powers many modern technologies such as recommendation systems, voice assistants,
            self-driving cars, and fraud detection.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Is Machine Learning Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning helps computers recognize patterns, handle large amounts of data, 
            and automate tasks. It’s used in almost every industry and continues to grow as 
            technology advances.
