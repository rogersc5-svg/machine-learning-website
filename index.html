        <h2>What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning, or ML, is a part of AI that lets computers learn from data and make decisions on their own. 
            Basically, it’s like teaching a computer to figure things out without giving it step-by-step instructions. 
            ML is behind stuff we use every day, like Netflix recommendations, voice assistants, self-driving cars, and even fraud detection.

        <h2>Why Is Machine Learning Useful?</h2>
        <p>
            ML helps computers spot patterns, work with huge amounts of data, and do tasks automatically. 
            It’s used in tons of industries, from healthcare to finance, and it’s only getting more important as technology improves.
