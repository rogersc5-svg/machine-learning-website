        <h2>The History of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of Machine Learning started in the 1950s with early artificial intelligence programs.
            In 1952, Arthur Samuel created one of the first learning programs, a checkers-playing AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 1980s and 1990s, advances in algorithms and computing power allowed ML to grow.
            Neural networks were developed, allowing computers to recognize patterns in data.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 2000s, the rise of big data and more powerful computers accelerated Machine Learning,
            leading to modern applications like self-driving cars, voice recognition, and recommendation systems.
