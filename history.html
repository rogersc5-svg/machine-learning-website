        <h2>A Quick Look at the History of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning actually started way back in the 1950s with some of the first AI programs. 
            One of the earliest was made by Arthur Samuel in 1952 — it was a program that could play checkers and get better over time.

            Fast forward to the 1980s and 1990s, computers got faster and algorithms got smarter. 
            People started using neural networks, which helped computers recognize patterns in data more easily.

        <p>
            Then in the 2000s, the explosion of big data and even more powerful computers made ML grow super fast. 
            That’s when we started seeing modern stuff like self-driving cars, voice assistants, and recommendation systems.
