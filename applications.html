        <h2>How Machine Learning Is Used Today</h2>

        <h3>1. Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
            Machine Learning helps doctors and hospitals figure out medical stuff faster. 
            For example, it can spot diseases in medical images or help create treatment plans that fit each patient better.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Self-Driving Cars</h3>
        <p>
            ML is what makes self-driving cars actually drive themselves. 
            It looks at data from sensors to see obstacles, decide what to do, and stay safe on the road.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Recommendation Systems</h3>
        <p>
            Ever wondered how Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify seem to know what you like? 
            ML studies what you watch or listen to and recommends new stuff you might enjoy.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Fraud Detection</h3>
        <p>
            Banks use ML to spot weird or suspicious activity in accounts so they can prevent fraud before it happens.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Voice Assistants (NLP)</h3>
        <p>
            Your voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, use ML to understand what you’re saying and respond correctly. 
            Pretty cool, right?
