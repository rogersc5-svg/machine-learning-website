        <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>

        <h3>1. Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
            ML is used to analyze medical data, assist in diagnosis, and predict patient outcomes.
            Examples include detecting diseases from medical images and personalizing treatment plans.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Self-Driving Cars</h3>
        <p>
            ML powers autonomous vehicles by analyzing sensor data to detect objects, make decisions,
            and navigate safely on roads.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Recommendation Systems</h3>
        <p>
            Platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use ML to recommend movies, videos, and music
            based on user preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Fraud Detection</h3>
        <p>
            Banks and credit companies use ML algorithms to detect unusual transactions and prevent fraud.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
        <p>
            Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant rely on ML to understand and respond
            to human language.
